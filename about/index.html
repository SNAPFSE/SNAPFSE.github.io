<p>Dr. Carla Mazefsky is an Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh and a licensed clinical psychologist. She is an internationally recognized expert in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially as it relates to emotion regulation and co-occurring mental health conditions. Her research takes a lifespan approach and includes both those with ASD who are severely affected (e.g., nonverbal, have intellectual disability, and severe challenging behavior) and those who are verbal with average or better cognitive ability.</p>

<p>Her primary emphasis is clinical research, including measure and treatment development. She developed the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) which is now in use in more than a dozen countries and across the US in clinical and research settings. Dr. Mazefsky also co-authored the first emotion regulation intervention for adolescents and adults with ASD called the Emotion Awareness and Skills Enhancement (EASE) Program.</p>

<p>Dr. Aizenstein is an expert on the cognitive and affective neuroscience of aging and geriatric brain disorders. He is trained as a geriatric psychiatrist and also a computer scientist. His research program is recognized for expertise in MRI analyses methods, as well as their use for clinical research in aging.</p>

<p>Dr. Aizenstein’s research group has developed semi-automated methods of morphometric and functional MRI analyses. He uses structural and functional neuroimaging to identify networks of brain regions associated with affective and cognitive processing, and how these change over time with and without intervention.</p>

<p>Dr. Aizenstein has experience with fMRI studies in a variety of psychiatric disorders involving mood and cognitive disorders. He will contribute his expertise in brain imaging, the analysis of brain images, and geriatric psychiatry. He has extensively worked with the other PIs and Co-Is through several NIH funded grants and publications. He is a skilled and valued mentor; he received the 2009 Departmental mentorship award. He has collaborated and mentored many investigators, including K awardees, post-doctoral students and graduate students.</p>

<p>My name is Maria Palmer I was born on June 7th 1993 I live in McKeesport, Pa I graduated McKeesport on June 8th 2011 the day after my 18th birthday but I didn’t always live in McKeesport I use to live in Elizabeth Forward until the summer of 2006 when I moved to McKeesport in my 8th grade year. When I was growing up I was shy and timid person didn’t want to ask people to hang out didn’t really go out as much as I am now but it is thanks to the mon yough resource center that I have been blooming a lot now ever since than I have been involved with many kinds of groups, Volunteering at the Carnegie Science Center and events to show my support for many communities because I have been involved with McKeesport Community Newsroom which are a Photography and Journaling group that is helped by Point Park University. Martha Rial is the person in charge and anybody can join we sometimes have our meeting at the old Daily News Building other times we meet on zoom but we travel all over the mon valley and we even wrote a book called the Corona Diaries which is on sell on amazon for $10. I have worked at Kennywood Park started in 2014 in Food and Beverage stopped going for a couple of years and then when the pandemic started I came back in 2020 in 2022. I became a rides operator in my 4th year but it was my first year as a ride operator and a scare actor during Phantom Fall Fest. I have been Volunteer at the Carnegie Science Center since 2018 where I do many kinds of events. I am very enthusiastic, positive and creative I love to write stories, crafting, music both singing and play flute, I also created my own blog on podcast, facebook and youtube called T.I.E Together Individual Entertainment along with businesses like my photography business called T.I.P True Image Photography because I love to take pictures and I see things much more different than others that’s why I also love to be creative but I have been showing my support for autism awareness as well since I have autism and I am glad that the people like Tim Burton, Jerry Seinfeld, Hans Christian Anderson, Emily Dickson, Lewis Carrol, Michelangelo, Mozart and our very own Pittsburgh Native Andy Warhol has made me realize not to be ashamed for what I have but learn to accept it and it because of them that I have been inspired to finally show support and speak up about me having autism and it is because of them that I am not ashamed anymore like I was many years ago I now feel proud to be autistic to inspire others as well who has autism I am happy and proud to be who I am to this very day. I am now back at Kennywood as a rides operator maybe as a scare actor for the phantom fall fest for this of 2023 things are different but I am trying to start as many fundraisers as I can as well because of what happened at Elizabeth Forward High School on Feb 12th I want to help as much as I can because the music department got hit pretty badly I may not have graduated from that school but it is still close to my heart and that is the place to where my older siblings and family friend graduated from so there is a lot of things that I mostly know about me but I hope you also got to enjoy a lot of information that I have shared with you as well</p>

<p>Dr. Handen is a leader in the development of clinical services for children with autism and developmental disabilities, and an internationally recognized researcher in the field of autism and developmental disabilities.</p>

<p>After obtaining a PhD from the University of Massachusetts, Dr. Handen completed his clinical psychology internship at Brown University and a postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In 1985 he began his career at the University of Pittsburgh as an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and later joined the Department of Psychiatry as an associate professor.

<p>Dr. Handen is responsible for many notable contributions in the clinical area. He oversaw the opening of two new partial hospital programs and an outpatient autism diagnostic clinic at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC), and was instrumental in developing wraparound services that provide practical help to families experiencing severe psychosocial stressors, such as those with childhood psychiatric disorders. Dr. Handen also spearheaded the adaption of evidence-based diagnostic and psychosocial treatments for populations with autism spectrum disorder at the Merck Child Outpatient Clinic. He continues to actively see patients at the Merck Child Clinic, proving both diagnostic and treatment services.</p>

<p>Dr. Alexis Franks specializes in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, and her area of clinical focus is the care of children with neurogenetic and neurodevelopmental conditions in addition to general pediatric neurological concerns. Her research is focused on investigating underlying etiologies of neurodevelopmental conditions, specifically perinatal exposures to exogenous compounds. Her active projects include the study of prenatal exposure to the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol and how they influence cellular metabolism and gene expression within the developing brain. She also is evaluating how perinatal exposure to glucocorticoids can affect neurodevelopment, and how molecular interactions between glucocorticoid and endocannabinoid signaling pathways lead to differential outcomes.</p>
