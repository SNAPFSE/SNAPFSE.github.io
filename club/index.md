# What we Do
## Community Events
These events provide a chance for neurotypical and neurodiverse communities to collaborate on a shared project or activity. Examples include creating a mural, going on a nature walk, organizing a fundraising run, or hosting a food sale. These events not only promote interaction and communication between the communities but also raise funds for future events and supporting other organizations.

## Speaker Events
We will host events featuring various influencers and speakers from the neurodiverse community, medical scientists, and local leaders. They will share their experiences and knowledge with the community, address issues, educate the public, and advocate. Events will be held at least once a month during the academic year.

## SNAP Volunteering
SNAP Volunteering partners with UPMC's Disability Resource Center (DRC) to provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities at UPMC Presbyterian and UPMC Shadyside. We work closely with the DRC to ensure patients' physical, communicative, and emotional needs are met. Our goal is to enhance patients' experience in the hospital and make their stay as smooth as possible. We plan to expand our reach to more hospitals in the future to continue this mission.
