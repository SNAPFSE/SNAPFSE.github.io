The SNAP club was created to create a community with greater knowledge of neurodiversity, while enhancing social interactions between neurotypical and neurodiverse people. We will be primarily focused on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but are inclusive to all neurodiverse people, such as those with Schizophrenia, Paranoia, Down Syndrome, Epilepsy, and Aspergerâ€™s syndrome. SNAP helps with volunteer efforts with the community to create fundraisers for Pittsburgh neurodiverse organizations, aid in hospitals by providing emotional support, and having speakers talk about the neurodiverse differences to inform the public more about neurodiversity. Our mission is to create, make, volunteer, inform, and collaborate. The goal is to create a platform that allows for the neurodiverse and neurotypical communities to interact and communicate.
