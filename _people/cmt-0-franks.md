Dr. Alexis Franks specializes in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, and her area of clinical focus is the care of children with neurogenetic and neurodevelopmental conditions in addition to general pediatric neurological concerns. Her research is focused on investigating underlying etiologies of neurodevelopmental conditions, specifically perinatal exposures to exogenous compounds. Her active projects include the study of prenatal exposure to the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol and how they influence cellular metabolism and gene expression within the developing brain. She also is evaluating how perinatal exposure to glucocorticoids can affect neurodevelopment, and how molecular interactions between glucocorticoid and endocannabinoid signaling pathways lead to differential outcomes.
