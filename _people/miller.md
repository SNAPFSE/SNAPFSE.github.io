Zachary is the Founder and President of SNAP, a program he developed in early 2022 to build a supportive platform that promotes inclusion and understanding between the neurodiverse and neurotypical communities. As a brother of two siblings with Autism, Zachary is deeply committed to finding ways to help his siblings and the community as a whole. He currently attends the University of Pittsburghâ€™s Swanson School of Engineering as a pre-medical student, majoring in Bioengineering and minoring in Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, and Conceptual Foundations of Medicine.

In addition to his work with SNAP, Zachary is a Co-lead Undergraduate Researcher with the Soft Tissue Biomechanics Lab. He also worked with the Neural Tissue Lab in 2021 as an Undergraduate Researcher. He has deep connections with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, where he has been a Medical Assistant, a Psychiatric Care Attendant, and currently works as a Patient Care Technician. Zachary has a wealth of experience in healthcare and research which he brings to SNAP.

Zachary also works as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Organic Chemistry classes, and acts as a Co-Chair for first-year engineering students. He is a dedicated student who is always pushing himself to achieve more, and his drive, compassion, and energy make him an invaluable leader. He is constantly striving to make a positive impact in the lives of those around him.
