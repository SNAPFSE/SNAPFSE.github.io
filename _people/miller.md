Zachary Miller founded SNAP with the hopes that it would help in increasing communication within the neurodiverse community and give greater opportunities for new neurodiverse and neurotypical interactions. As a middle child between a brother and a sister who were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at a young age, Zachary Miller has seen all aspects of the struggles in neurodiverse adolescence. Growing up, he and his parents commonly discussed different ways to help my brother and sister with their struggles whether it be academic, work, or social. In one of these discussions, he and his mother were conversing about my sister Addison’s social life. Addison has always been the social butterfly of the family. She wants to talk to anyone who’s willing to and is always looking to strike up a conversation and make new friends.
