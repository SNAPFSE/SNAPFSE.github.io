My brother and sister were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at a young age, and as the middle child, I have seen all aspects of the struggles in neurodiverse adolescence. My parents and I will commonly discuss different ways to help my brother and sister with their struggles whether it be academic, work, or social. In one of these discussions, my mother and I were conversing about my sister Addison’s social life. Addison has always been the social butterfly of the family. She wants to talk to anyone who’s willing to and is always looking to strike up a conversation and make new friends.
