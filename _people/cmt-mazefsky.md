Dr. Carla Mazefsky is an Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh and a licensed clinical psychologist. She is an internationally recognized expert in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially as it relates to emotion regulation and co-occurring mental health conditions. Her research takes a lifespan approach and includes both those with ASD who are severely affected (e.g., nonverbal, have intellectual disability, and severe challenging behavior) and those who are verbal with average or better cognitive ability.

Her primary emphasis is clinical research, including measure and treatment development. She developed the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) which is now in use in more than a dozen countries and across the US in clinical and research settings. Dr. Mazefsky also co-authored the first emotion regulation intervention for adolescents and adults with ASD called the Emotion Awareness and Skills Enhancement (EASE) Program.
