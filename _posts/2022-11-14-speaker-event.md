Kate Marhelko is a graduate from the Fashion Institute of Technology with a BFA in Textile and Surface Design and obtained a Masters in Early Childhood Education from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. Kate has designed consumer products for Disney, The MLB and the hand warmers the NFL players wear during her time living in Manhattan. She also was a top 5 finalist to Miss Pennsylvania International, Miss Pennsylvania Intercontinental, held the title of Miss Pennsylvania American Coed with the MAC system, Miss Greater Hazleton and Miss Hershey Area a preliminary to the Miss America Organization. Kate is currently an active volunteer with the Miss Greater Hazleton Scholarship Organization, an affiliate with the Miss Pennsylvania Volunteer Inc, where she has actively mentoring current title holders and assisting preparation for the state pageant. Currently Kate is known for her most favorite title of all, “Miss. Marhelko” as she is an elementary art teacher in the Hazleton Area School District. 

Through all of Kate’s accomplishments, she just found out later in life that she has Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, otherwise known as ADHD. Kate will be addressing the SNAP program regarding her disability from a personal and professional level as an educator. She will discuss the challenges she faces herself and how she has been able to reach so many students with neurodivergent and intellectual disabilities since her diagnosis. Kate is currently working on becoming a self published author and illustrator. She hopes her children’s book, Arnie Discovers He’s Different, brings representation into the classroom and educates our youth on truly what ADHD is. Kate hopes to inspire the students of PITT and bring light to neurodivergent community with this opportunity.
