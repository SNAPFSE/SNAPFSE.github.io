## The Big Picture

Can you bring your creative and visionary skills to help make change in the world?

Contagious enthusiasm for SNAPFSE’s mission and the passion to learn is essential in this role.

## About Us

[Special Needs Assistance Program for Social Engagement](http://snapfse.com) (**SNAPFSE**) was created to increase the engagement, awareness, and communication between neurodiverse and neurotypical people, bringing both groups together to create a stronger bond and better understanding of each other. SNAP expands into four individual projects, each with its unique mission to spread love and support for neurodiversity.

## Project Description

The SNAP App offers a new social media platform for neurodiverse friends to meet, interact, and discover one another. The app will feature:

1. **Ability to schedule and make in-person hangout sessions**: participants can find common meeting spaces suggested by the program to hangout out and meet with new neurodiverse and neurotypical individuals.
2. **A matching system based on preferences**: Using location, preferences, and tags, SNAP will match you in your feed with like-minded people.
3. **A chat system with integrated machine learning for easier neurodiverse communication and interpretation**: a chat system will be integrated into the system for easy, quick communication with new people that you meet. It will also include special needs capabilities that allow for neurodiverse participants to have more ease and comfort with communication.
4. **The SNAP Research Initiative (SRI)**: SRI is a research component linked to a larger project. The SRI will give consenting individuals the opportunity to contribute to ASD research by prompting participants to fill out a questionnaire after social interactions.
5. **A “support” (aid) account linking system**: Supports can join SNAP and help their participant in the program
6. **Video chat feature for virtual meets**: a video call system will be available for virtual hangouts for those that prefer to not meet in-person or may have difficulty otherwise meeting outside.
