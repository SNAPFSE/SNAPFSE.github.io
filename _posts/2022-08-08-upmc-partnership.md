We are very excited to announce that we will be working with UPMC to create a new volunteer program within their hospitals. The SNAP-UPMC volunteering program will target aiding those that identify with a disability with emotional and physical support. We will do this by supplying them with fidget objects, supporting items, and other gadgets that can work to make for a calm and happy environment.

Additionally, the volunteers will work to stay in the rooms with the patient for as long as the patient would like to give them someone to interact with, confide in, or just have company. The volunteers will be trained by UPMC and SNAP to help the patients in the best ways possible.

The program will take place in UPMC Presbyterian and UPMC Shadyside, but will eventually spread to other UPMC hospitals. The hope is to make the hospital a more friendly and enjoyable experience for those who have disabilities and may struggle with the bleakness of the hospital setting.

We look forward to growing this program to help as many patients as possible. If you would like to help and are not a member, consider joining SNAP by clicking the link below!
