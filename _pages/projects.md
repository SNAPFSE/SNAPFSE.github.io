## SNAP App
The SNAP App offers a new social media platform for neurodiverse friends to meet, interact, and discover one another. The app will feature:
1. **Ability to schedule and make in-person hangout sessions**: participants can find common meeting spaces suggested by the program to hangout out and meet with new neurodiverse and neurotypical individuals.
2.	**A matching system based on preferences**: Using location, preferences, and tags, SNAP will match you in your feed with like-minded people.
3.	**A chat system with integrated machine learning for easier neurodiverse communication and interpretation**: a chat system will be integrated into the system for easy, quick communication with new people that you meet. It will also include special needs capabilities that allow for neurodiverse participants to have more ease and comfort with communication.
4.	**The SNAP Research Initiative (SRI)**: SRI is a research component linked to a larger project. The SRI will give consenting individuals the opportunity to contribute to ASD research by prompting participants to fill out a questionnaire after social interactions.
5.	**A “support” (aid) account linking system**: Supports can join SNAP and help their participant in the program
6.	**Video chat feature for virtual meets**: a video call system will be available for virtual hangouts for those that prefer to not meet in-person or may have difficulty otherwise meeting outside.

## SNAP Research
After the development of the SNAP App, we realized that there was limited research in the best ways to have social intervention that best supports neurodiverse children. SNAP Research was made to find the best social intervention to help Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) adolescents with their social impairment and aid them in adjusting to a neurotypical-based world. The hope is that this research can aid in calibrating the best ways to help ASD individuals with social compliance and resilience. Access the research abstract below!

## SRI
The SNAP Research Initiative (SRI) was created to be a link between the SNAP app and research. The SRI will allow for data collection on the app to help with the SNAP research. Surveys will be taken before and after social interactions on the app from the neurodiverse individuals to ascertain if there was a change in their social impairment and compliance. SRI can help supplement SNAP research with finding the best way to socially intervene not just for ASD, but for many more neurological disorders. To learn more, sign up for the SNAP Newsletter!

## The SNAP Club
The SNAP club was created to help all the other programs. Their mission is to create, make, volunteer, inform, and collaborate. The goal is to create a platform that allows for the neurodiverse and neurotypical communities to interact and communicate. The members will help make events to interact more with the neurodiverse community, volunteer within hospitals to help special needs individuals, inform and present to the public about different neurological disorders, and collaborate with other aspects of SNAP and the neurodiverse community to spread happiness and build friendships.
