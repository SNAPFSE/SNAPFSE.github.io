In 2022, the Special Needs Assistance Program for Social Engagement was created with aims of increasing the engagement, awareness, and communication between the neurodiverse and neurotypical people. SNAP sought out to create opportunities to bring both groups together to create a stronger bond and better understanding of each other. Since our founding, we've worked with numerous neurodiverse organization to engage our members and the community in activities to promote inclusivity bonding.

Recently, SNAP partnered with the Pittsburgh Center for Art and Media (a non-profit organization that focuses on using art to bring the Pittsburgh community together) and artist Alison Zapata to help create a mural on Pitt's campus. The mural, designed by Alison Zapata, is inspired by the neurodiversity sign and signifies a path towards a more inclusive environment.

The mural was created by a mix of 16 Pitt students and 16 neurodiverse volunteers who worked in collaboration to stencil and paint it.
