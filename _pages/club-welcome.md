Hello,

Welcome to SNAP Club! We are so happy that you decided to sign up! Our goal of the SNAP Club is to create a platform that allows for the neurodiverse and neurotypical communities to interact, communicate, and collaborate more. Our meetings are on the **first and third Wednesdays** of each month. The _first Wednesday is a SNAP discussion meeting_, the _third Wednesday will be SNAP speaker meetings_. We will inform you when a meeting is coming up or if anything changes.

We will have t-shirts dispersed out to you. Please give in your dues of $5 to any of the SNAP Club Advisory Team (Venmo: [@Ashley-Sabia-4](https://account.venmo.com/u/Ashley-Sabia-4) or _hand in cash_). As soon as you hand in your dues, we will contact you about where to receive your shirt from!

If you are looking to **volunteer with UPMC through our partnership**, we will be sending more information to you on how to fulfill that process in another email.

**Community events** are for interacting more with the neurodiverse community and finding new ways to help them. We will have forums activities to have fun with them and interact with them more! More information will come with when community events will occur.

There is so much to come, and we will keep you in the loop with updates and upcoming events. Thank you for joining, and welcome to SNAP Club!

SNAP Advisory Team  
**Zachary Miller** - _President_  
**Nicholas Vasas** - _Vice President_  
**Ashley Sabia** - _Business Manager/PR_
