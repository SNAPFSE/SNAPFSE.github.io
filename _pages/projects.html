        <p class="card-text">
          After the development of the SNAP App, we realized that there was
          limited research in the best ways to have social intervention that
          best supports neurodiverse children. SNAP Research was made to find
          the best social intervention to help Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
          adolescents with their social impairment and aid them in adjusting to
          a neurotypical-based world. The hope is that this research can aid in
          calibrating the best ways to help ASD individuals with social
          compliance and resilience. Access the research abstract below!

          The SNAP club was created to help all the other programs. Their
          mission is to create, make, volunteer, inform, and collaborate. The
          goal is to create a platform that allows for the neurodiverse and
          neurotypical communities to interact and communicate. The members will
          help make events to interact more with the neurodiverse community,
          volunteer within hospitals to help special needs individuals, inform
          and present to the public about different neurological disorders, and
          collaborate with other aspects of SNAP and the neurodiverse community
          to spread happiness and build friendships. To be a part of fun, click
