        Zachary Miller founded SNAP for his sister who was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at a young age. Through SNAP, he wanted to give his sister a better chance at finding friends to interact and socialize with. By creating the SNAP social platform, he hopes that she can develop the friendships and connections that she wants and craves.
