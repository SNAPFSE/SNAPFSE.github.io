SNAP is not just a platform, but also a mentality. We are dedicated to advocating for the neurodiverse community, specifically, aiding them in being integrated into the neurotypical-based world! To help, please consider joining SNAP club, volunteering with special needs organizations, and supporting special needs assistance groups.
