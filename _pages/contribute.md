description: Learn how you can help the Neurodiverse community!
---

SNAP is not just a platform, but also a mentality. We are dedicated to advocating for the neurodiverse community, specifically, aiding them in being integrated into the neurotypical-based world! To help, please consider joining SNAP club, volunteering with special needs organizations, and supporting special needs assistance groups.

Any Pitt student who joins [SNAP Club](/projects/#the-snap-club)’s team will promote communication between the neurodiverse and neurotypical communities and give more opportunities for new interactions.

Members of SNAP will [volunteer with UPMC](/2022/08/08/upmc-partnership.html) hospitals near Pitt’s campus and assist patients with special needs by socializing and spending time with them.

They will also create platforms and events for the neurodiverse and neurotypical communities to interact and communicate.

SNAP members will also inform the public about neurodiversities and collaborate with other aspects of SNAP and the neurodiverse community to build frienships.
